Anyone who has studied computer networking knows that network interfaces receive
packets, which go through various layers. In theory, that's pretty easy to
understand, but it leaves the person with many questions : 
- How does the machine know it has received a packet?
- What does "travelling" through the layers mean in the code?
- How do firewalls perform operations on these packets? 
- How do applications "receive" packets to their file descriptors?
- What are sockets, and how are they implemented? 

Bugged by these same doubts, I will explore the source code to answer
these questions from a student's perspective, going to as much depth as needed
and not going down the rabbit hole. Networking in the Linux kernel is much more
than these blogs cover. This complex code has undergone many improvements and
optimizations, bringing Linux to the forefront of cloud technologies. 

The network stacks are logical layers that perform different operations and
handle other responsibilities in receiving and transmitting packets. The Linux
Kernel implements four layers[^1]: **Link Layer** (Ethernet), **Network Layer** (IP, ARP),
**Transport Layer** (TCP, UDP, etc.), and **Session Layer** (sockets and files).

Figure 1 summarises the flow of the packet in the receive path. To make it
easier for me and the readers to understand, I have divided the flow into
multiple sections, each with a dedicated blog post. The sections are :
- Binary to packet (sk_buff)
- Bridging and IP traversal
- Transport Layer traversal
- Sockets

### Binary to packet

1. The **NIC** (Network Interface Card) receives and copies the packet to a **ring
  buffer** using Direct Memory Access (don't worry, I will discuss these in their
  respective blogs).

2. After copying the packet to the buffer, it informs the CPU about it (see
  [interrupts](https://wiki.osdev.org/Interrupts)). The CPU acknowledges the
  interrupt, runs the registered Hardware Interrupt Handler, and schedules
  **NAPI** (which schedules the Bottom Half or SoftIRQ handler for `NET_RX_SOFTIRQ`).

3. The SoftIRQ handler consumes the packet from the DMA'ed ring buffer (in the
  first step) using the device's registered **NAPI poll handler** and allocates
  a data structure called **sk_buff** to hold it, which is used everywhere in
  the networking kernel subsystem. 

4. It then runs **CRC** calls, processes **VLAN**  tags, passes packets to
  **TAPs** and other **sniffers**, calls **XDP hooks** and invokes the entry function
  of the next layer (example: `ip_rcv` for the IP layer) with the created `skb.`
  We call this process "sending the packet up the stack."
